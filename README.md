# UBC Student Dashboard
Due to new regulations and guidelines arising from efforts against the COVID-19 pandemic, the [UBC Learning Analytics Spring Hackathon](https://github.com/UBC-LA-Hackathon/student-dashboard) will be rescheduled to a later date. 

This is my attempt to work through the project prepared by the hackathon organizers, which is a simple web-app that takes course discussion data from Canvas, and provides visualizations on the distribution of times at which discussions occur. 

The original README file for the project can be found [here](./README-original.md).
