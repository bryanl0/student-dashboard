# UBC Student Dashboard

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/8f39ded9-dda6-4340-ae7d-9ba1cc5ca2e7/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/bryans-student-dashboard/deploys)

Due to new regulations and guidelines arising from efforts against the COVID-19 pandemic, the [UBC Learning Analytics Spring Hackathon](https://github.com/UBC-LA-Hackathon/student-dashboard) will be rescheduled to a later date. 

This is my attempt to work through the project prepared by the hackathon organizers, which is a simple web-app that takes course discussion data from Canvas, and provides visualizations on the distribution of times at which discussions occur. 

The original README file for the project can be found [here](./README_original.md).
